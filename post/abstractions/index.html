    <article  id="articleContent" class="post-content" style="position:relative;">
        <p>I recently came across an interesting <a href="https://www.xefer.com/wikipedia">website</a>.</p>
<p>The idea behind it is to Wikipedia any word we choose, and click on the first hyperlink that appears in the description for that word. This takes us to another Wikipedia page, where the website will also click on the first hyperlink in that description, and so on.</p>
<p>For example, this is the Wikipedia page for “computer”.</p>
<p><img src="/images/blog/abstractions/Computer.png" alt="Image"></p>
<p>In this case, the first hyperlink is “machine”, so that website will click on it, go to the “machine” Wikipedia page, click on the first hyperlink there, and so forth.</p>
<p>It keeps doing this until it reaches the word “philosophy”. At that point, the hyperlinks keep circling words like “reason”, “consciousness”, “logic” and back to “philosophy”, so the website chooses to there.</p>
<p>We are also given a path that traces down from the word we choose all the way to “philosophy”.</p>
<p><img src="/images/blog/abstractions/chain.png" alt="Image"></p>
<p>I thought this was a fascinating display of how profound everything around us is. Just the word “computer” relies on the understanding of so many complicated subjects. Not to mention the countless other things that exist in the world outside of computers.</p>
<p>The world is laughably complex. No one is even close to knowing everything. Even for an alien like Einstein himself, &ldquo;<em>The more I learn, the more I realize how much I don&rsquo;t know.</em>&rdquo;</p>
<p>However, we still manage to carry on with our daily lives as if the world around us is quite simple. We do not concern ourselves with the laws of physics while browsing Instagram, for example, even though a deep understanding of these laws is what allowed Instagram to exist.</p>
<p>So how did this insane complexity of the world get reduced to a simplicity which allows us to live with incredible advancements, like a computer or Instagram, without ever considering how they came to be?</p>
<p><strong>Because we can substitute complicated understandings of something for easily digestible ideas in our mind. We can abstract away all the complexity and only deal with the minimum we need to know.</strong></p>
<p>Who cares, or even has the time, to understand the laws of physics, the development of the internet, and all the years of software engineering that went behind Instagram?</p>
<p><img src="/images/blog/abstractions/meme.png" alt="Image"></p>
<p>We hide away all the knowledge that is unnecessary for our day-to-day lives and only concern ourselves with the minimum amount of information needed. <strong>We create abstractions.</strong></p>
<p>Abstractions are simple ideas that provide us with generalizations of the world that are easily accessible, and which help us not have to think deeply about the subject at hand. Our brains are lazy and fallible, and we only want to think about the minimum we need to know.</p>
<p>Our abstraction of Instagram, for example, is that it is an app which we can upload pictures and videos and communicate with friends. It has a friendly user interface, and it is easy to use.</p>
<p>The full reality of Instagram, however, would be impossible to discuss without a deep understanding of software engineering, cybersecurity, the internet, the laws of physics…</p>
<p>But as consumers of the app, we do not need to know about any of these things. That entire complexity is hidden away from us so that we do not even bother to know how it came to be.</p>
<p><strong>And we do this for everything around us, not just Instagram.</strong></p>
<p>When we take antibiotics, are we thinking about all their chemical bonds, or are we simply taking pills to make us better?</p>
<p>When we drive our cars, are we thinking about the laws of thermodynamics, or are we just driving where we need to go?</p>
<p>Every day, with everything around us, we are always operating at an incredibly superficial level of understanding.</p>
<p>And this is quite amazing when looked at because even though the world is so complicated, it is also designed in such an incredible way to be usable even though we know very little about it. And perhaps even more incredibly, this is <strong>only possible because of trust. Whenever there is an abstraction, there is always trust.</strong></p>
<p>This trust is deeply embedded in the vulnerability we are constantly placing ourselves in. Since we do not know exactly how our computers, our antibiotics, or our cars work, how can we really make sure they will work as intended? How can we make sure our computers are not spying on us, that our antibiotics will not make us sick, and that our cars will not lose their brakes?</p>
<p>We have no way to stop and analyze each of them individually since most of us lack the knowledge and the time to do so. These things will be handed to us, and we will have an abstraction of how they work, we will use them, and we will trust them with our lives.</p>
<p>We are always at the mercy of others. From where we get our food to where we get our transportation. We have no choice but to be in this position. We are incapable of knowing how those things fully work, and we are incapable of making those things ourselves. The world has an extraordinary amount of information, and we are unable to deal with all of it.</p>
<p>All we can do is <strong>abstract</strong> and <strong>trust</strong>.</p>
<h2 id="misinformation-overload-and-the-land-of-bad-abstractions">(Mis)information overload and the Land of Bad Abstractions.</h2>
<p>We live in the era of <strong>information overload.</strong></p>
<p><img src="/images/blog/abstractions/overload2.png" alt="Image"></p>
<p><a href="https://www.bnpadvisors.com/information-overload-clinic/"><em>Image source</em></a></p>
<p>The world today is the most complex it has ever been. Industries are extremely specialized. Technology is more advanced than ever before. The sheer amount of information available on anything can be overwhelming.</p>
<p>And the access we have to all of this information is unprecedented. The digital revolution opened a door to almost all of the world’s information at a scale we have never seen before.</p>
<p>Billions of us carry devices that can, instantly, order food online, text anyone, browse any social media platform, watch videos on dogs or quantum mechanics, read academic journals, listen to any song ever composed, and do all the millions of other things from TikToks to Minecraft.</p>
<p>All of this at our sides, almost every minute of every day. Whether we are working, talking, or even sleeping, the Pandora’s box is right next to us, blaring notification after notification that something is happening out there.</p>
<p>Standing so close to this overwhelming vortex of information can transform us into modern-day zombies. As the price we pay for this access to everything, we are often placed into this constant state of alertness, anxiety, stress, loneliness, hormonal fluctuations, and all the other serious issues from sleep deprivation to a sense of insufficiency because of the “comparison apocalypse” social media can induce.</p>
<p>And sadly, transforming us into modern zombies is in the interest of many large tech firms. This Pandora’s box we possess is not some mystical phenomenon that suddenly appeared in our laps. It is exactly what tech corporations wanted to create. And I do not mean this in a conspiratorial way, I mean it as an illustration of the digital revolution that brought forth this information overload.</p>
<p>As highlighted in the <em>Social Dilemma</em>, as one example, we now live in a world where the term “attention economy” is a mantra that corporations live by. Our attention spans are short, and the amount of information is nearly infinite, so now, more than ever, every single company has at their core the question of “<em>how can we keep consumers hooked to our products and services as long as possible to ensure they are not doing something else?</em>”</p>
<p>The logic gates of the digital revolution have been opened. Ironically, the smartphones in our pockets which serve as the door to this new Matrix are quite lightweight, but carrying them around every single day seems to be a lot heavier than we all expected.</p>
<p><strong>We are overloaded.</strong></p>
<p>Which brings us back to abstractions.</p>
<p>We deal with information by creating abstractions because it is impossible to keep up with everything, especially today. So, since we are dealing with more information, we will have to create more abstractions.</p>
<p><strong>However, because we live in this age of information overload, we are bound to create bad abstractions.</strong></p>
<p>A good abstraction hides all the complexity away from us but still leaves a simple idea, which is <strong>based on truth</strong>, in our minds.</p>
<p>A bad abstraction is one that also hides all the complexity away but leaves a simple idea that is <strong>based on misinformation</strong>.</p>
<p>And unfortunately, we are bound to create bad abstractions for two reasons.</p>
<p>First, the information overload has the unfortunate consequence of containing so much misinformation and ignorance. We live in a world where “fake news” has become a household term. We acquire the majority of our information online, yet it is extremely trivial to manipulate such information online. Swarm of bots, indistinguishable from humans, are created daily to disrupt our social cohesion and spread misinformation. This happens from <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/technology/archive/2020/01/future-politics-bots-drowning-out-humans/604489/">election times</a> to <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/12/08/technology/why-cant-the-social-networks-stop-fake-accounts.html">day-to-day discussions on Facebook</a>.</p>
<p>Not to mention we can also get information from real human beings, and they too can spread misinformation. <strong>Thus, not only do we have to deal with an unprecedented amount of information, but now we also need to learn how to separate the truth from the lies.</strong></p>
<p>And second, we are extremely fallible thinkers. As individuals, we have a swarm of psychological biases that cloud our judgment. We are constantly influenced by factors that we do not even notice, but which have a massive impact on our decisions. As an example, consider this excerpt from the book <em>Hello World</em>, by Hannah Fry, as she talks about how judges can act in court.</p>
<p>“Sadly, when it comes to biased judges, I could go on. Judges with daughters are more likely to make decisions more favorable to women. Judges are less likely to award bail if the local sports team has lost recently. And one famous study even suggested that the time of day affects your chances of a favorable outcome. […] Another study showed that an individual judge will avoid making too many similar judgments in a row. Your chances, therefore, of being awarded bail drop off a cliff if four successful cases were heard immediately before yours.”</p>
<p>Here are external factors, completely unrelated to the question of whether someone is a criminal or not, which have a real impact on the outcome of the decision. If we subconsciously let something like a sports match affect the way we make life-changing decisions, we should immediately revisit the way we are thinking.</p>
<p>This unnoticed, irrational thinking that permeates our lives is a fascinating subject. The Nobel Prize winner Daniel Kahneman has written a wonderful book, <em>Thinking Fast and Slow</em>, which is dedicated to understanding more about how our brains work, and all the many bumps in the road.</p>
<p>In a very unfair and short summary, this <em>Fast</em> system of thought is where our instinctive and automatic thoughts come from, like when we form first impressions of someone, or when reacting to a fly hitting our face. The <em>Slow</em> system of thought is more conscious, analytical, and slow. It is what we use to think of a hard math question or finding a friend in a large crowd, for example.</p>
<p>Consider the following puzzle, posed by Kahneman.</p>
<p>A bat and a ball cost $1.10 in total.<br>
The bat costs $1 more than the ball.<br>
How much does the ball cost?</p>
<p>In all likelihood, you also had an immediate urge to respond that the ball cost 10 cents. This automatic, quick response is our <em>Fast</em> system talking. But that would be incorrect. If you did not arrive at the correct answer, which is 5 cents, no worries. The good news is that if you were at least thinking about it, you were engaging the Slow system.</p>
<p>More importantly, however, this entire example illustrates the constant battle that our Fast and Slow systems engage in. And while sometimes we may be able to coordinate our systems to arrive at the correct answer, other times we may simply let things go through. And if we let such things go through, we open the doors to countless logical fallacies and biases. We let the time of the day influence how we sentence someone to prison, for example.</p>
<p>And this dance between the two systems is constantly happening to every single one of us. We are always, from small to big decisions, being influenced by factors that we do not notice. The examples above are only a very tiny sliver of all the possible logical pitfalls we can fall in. The confirmation bias, for example, is an extremely common bias we all have to favor the information that aligns with our beliefs, even if that information is not true. It is a quick road from there to bad abstractions.</p>
<p>And unfortunately, this is not necessarily our fault. We did not design our brains. According to Kahneman, “<strong>The best we can do is a compromise: learn to recognize situations in which mistakes are likely and try harder to avoid significant mistakes when the stakes are high.</strong>”</p>
<p>And even beyond all of these logical flaws, we are also emotional creatures. We have desires, like belonging to a community, which might override the pursuit of reason, so we may become tribal and disregard anything other than what our “team” says, regardless of how wrong it is. We have feelings, like fear or uncertainty, that might be soothed by forming ideas in our mind about the things we are dealing with, and sometimes the ideas we form can be bad abstractions.</p>
<p>In short, if bad abstractions are the ones that are based on misinformation, then we will inevitably create such abstractions. Because we are fallible thinkers and because there is an extraordinary amount of misinformation around us, many of the pictures we will paint of reality will not be reflections of the truth, but reflections of ignorance and our own ineptitudes.</p>
<p>Combining everything from above, we find ourselves dangerous cycle:</p>
<p>The information overload spreading an extraordinary amount of misinformation, empowered by our fallibilities, which will create bad abstractions, which will distort our understanding of the world, which will at light speed propagate more misinformation…</p>
<p>And throughout the cycle, since abstractions and trust are two sides of the same coin, the bad abstractions will invoke trust in foundations that are built on misinformation and ignorance. Thus, will we be ever more fragmented in what we believe and trust, which is a clear road to antipathy, divisiveness, and violence.</p>
<p><strong>This is the Land of Bad Abstractions. And living here is problematic because this cycle of ignorance is suffocating.</strong></p>
<p>As one of the many examples, consider this pandemic, where many are adamantly anti-vaccine. Where their knowledge based on social media feeds is enough to contradict the years of diligent scientific work behind the creation of vaccines. Where some people sincerely believe that <a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/technology-52833706">Bill Gates wants to insert microchips in vaccines so that he can track us.</a>. Where <a href="https://www.thelancet.com/journals/laninf/article/PIIS1473-3099(20)30383-2/fulltext">scientific researchers get death threats</a> by conducting studies on the efficiency of treatments against Covid. All the while having absolutely no idea how a virus, a microchip, or a vaccine works all the way down.</p>
<p>These are bad abstractions. They are corrosive ideas that will only fuel more distrust amongst ourselves, and which will only bring more chaos to society. The hesitation to take vaccines, largely founded upon bad abstractions, is enough of a problem for the WHO to classify vaccine hesitancy as one of the <a href="https://www.who.int/news-room/spotlight/ten-threats-to-global-health-in-2019">top ten threats to global health</a>.</p>
<p>Bad ideas like this are spawned to life through a sincere misunderstanding of the truth. Through the clouding of reason by misinformation that was fermented by our fallibilities. And the result is a bad abstraction that is dangerous to society.
And this is not only for vaccines. If we rely on bad ideas, we will be always in the opposite direction of reason. How can we sincerely talk about extremely important topics, like climate change or racism, if all of our ideas are bad abstractions? <strong>How can we have meaningful conversations towards improvement when our dialogue is not based on truth, but based on our fallibilities and the misinformation we acquired to create our beliefs?</strong></p>
<p>And if we cannot use reason and see the truth, we will continue to allow misinformation and ignorance to run like wildfire through our minds, and that is something we cannot let happen.</p>
<p>Consider the Witch Hunts during the Medieval Ages, where a woman who was born as a redhead could be judged as a witch (simply for being a redhead), tortured to the point of death (to which her suffering forced her to confess to a crime which she did not commit) only to be brutally murdered (often by being burned alive), for confessing to such crime.</p>
<p>Yes, women were burned alive for being redheads at some point in time, because people were so obscurely ignorant about the world that they thought doing such a thing was justifiable and the proper thing to do.</p>
<p>Such horror, and the infinite others which arise from ignorance, have existed, and still exist to this day. <strong>The cost of misinformation and ignorance is unbearable</strong>, and today, spreading misinformation and being ignorant has never been easier.</p>
<p>Living in this land of bad abstractions is extremely tiring, stressful, and unproductive. Let someone come forward who has not ever thought of the words “<em>How can they be so stupid?</em>” when thinking about someone on the other side of an argument thinks, from conversations on politics to celebrity gossip. Bad ideas permeate every single area of our lives.</p>
<p>Beyond this sluggish weight and frustration, however, the most important concern is the pain and suffering that is inflicted on the people who are victims of bad abstractions. We might not have Witch Hunts anymore, but bad ideas still take countless forms today, from religious intolerance to tax loopholes for the uber-rich.</p>
<p>And living surrounded by bad ideas is no way to conduct our little blue marble, which is why we need to pack our bags and depart for something new altogether.</p>
<h2 id="the-clean-up">The clean-up</h2>
<p>We need to dissolve bad abstractions, especially in important subjects.</p>
<p>If we do that, we will be able to think more clearly and bypass ignorance. Our trust will converge in good abstractions which are based on reason and truth, we will have fewer conflicts, co-operate more, and be better prepared to make meaningful changes to ameliorate the many things which are wrong with the world today.</p>
<p>As Sam Harris puts it “<em>bad ideas, however sacred, cannot survive the company of good ones forever.</em>”</p>
<p>In short, as in the title, it is a call for reason. So how will we do it?</p>
<p>There are many things I could be missing (after all, this post is just an abstraction too!) but in my opinion, we can do the following four:</p>
<p><strong>1) An overhaul of the educational system</strong></p>
<p>I love education and view it as a basic human right that should be provided to every single person. Education, in general, is unequivocally good for people.</p>
<p>However, I am also always frustrated to see the abhorrent insistence that schools have at teaching years of topics that will be immediately forgotten the moment we walk out of exams. Why do we confine ourselves to this disastrous regurgitation of “knowledge”?</p>
<p>When in our school years did we learn about how to take care of our finances, or how to take care of our mental health, or how to do any of the thousands of things we need to do to navigate the world today?</p>
<p>The world is changing fast, and our educational institutions should be dynamic to accompany this change. We need, as a system, to re-evaluate our definitions of education.</p>
<p>Is it our responsibility to cram all of the information about chemical bonds so that we may get an “A” in our exams, or is it our responsibility to help develop our minds in a way that will help us better adjust to the outside world?</p>
<p>We must begin teaching anyone who enters an educational institution about critical thinking, personal biases, how to find reliable information online, the dangers of misinformation, and so much more – all of the neglected things we wish we knew now, things that are useful for our entire lives, and not just for college exams.</p>
<p>I would also propose for consideration the idea of extending our high school by a year or two. We could use this time as a fully immersive experience on how to be an adult – a time to explore interests, learn useful things, contribute to society in some way (volunteering, internships), and, in general, developing maturity and competency while still being under the safety net of the education umbrella.</p>
<p>It is a bit appalling to me that we force 16 and 17-year-olds to make decisions like where they want to go to college, what do they want to do with their lives, what are they going to study for the next four years, etc.</p>
<p>In this increasingly specialized world, we need more time to understand exactly what we want to do. And perhaps, even giving an extra year or two will not help. But how many people have switched their majors? Or even changed careers after graduating? How many of these people might have been on the “right” track earlier if they had more time and knew better?</p>
<p>We need to give people more time and better tools to make these big decisions more wisely. And we also need to prepare them for what comes after.</p>
<p>Take this from a life expectancy perspective as well. Imagine a world where humans live to be 150 years old – do we still want to be graduating high school at 18? Why should we not have more time to develop ourselves if we are living longer?</p>
<p>Our planet is evolving extremely rapidly, and so should we. From individuals to the systems we build, we should constantly revisit these illusory lines of “maturity” and “education” and “adulthood” that we draw so that we do not lag behind the world around us.</p>
<p>We need to do a better job at supporting our educational system, upgrading it, and educating everyone so that future generations will be better prepared to deal with the world they were given.</p>
<p><strong>2) We need to be more aware of our fallibilities and sharpen our tools</strong></p>
<p><img src="/images/blog/abstractions/Illusion.png" alt="Image"></p>
<p>In the picture above, the dark blue lines are actually parallel. I looked at this illusion for a couple of minutes and only convinced myself they were indeed parallel by squinting quite a bit. Illusions are fun, but they are also impressive demonstrations of how our brains can misinterpret what is in front of us.</p>
<p>Illusions are one example, but we also have countless biases and fallibilities which also distort the way we see what is in front of us. The crucial difference is that when we are looking at an illusion for fun, we know that there is something at play and that perhaps squinting our eyes can help us see the true picture.</p>
<p>In real life, however, we are often unaware that we might be creating decisions that have been altered by our biases and fallibilities. We may think we are making a logical decision, but in fact, there are subconscious influences that push us away from that logical decision.</p>
<p>To that extent, we need to increase our awareness of the potential pitfalls we may fall into. We need to develop a mindset that can recognize situations where maybe we are indeed in an “illusion”, and that we need to “squint” our brains to get the full picture. And even though this is extremely tiring and nearly impossible to do, we should still try to do it when the stakes are high.</p>
<p>And one way to be more aware of these pitfalls is by enhancing our tools of reason. We can ask ourselves a lot of questions that might expose any logical pitfalls in our way towards a good decision.</p>
<p>Is our decision based on evidence and good thinking? Are we perhaps falling victim to confirmation bias? Do we really understand the reasons why we are choosing to do something? Could we rethink the problem <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NV3sBlRgzTI">first-principles</a> approach? How does our opinion compare with that of others? Where are we getting our information from? And so much more (that we could have been taught at school!)</p>
<p>And again, context. Going through mental checklists when picking what ice cream to buy is pointless, but when passing on a prison sentence to someone…</p>
<p>Being are of our fallibilities also means understanding when it happens in other people. We also need to sharpen a great instrument we all carry called the “<em>bullshit-o-meter</em>”. This instrument sends a signal in our heads whenever someone is telling us something we know is B.S.</p>
<p>And to sharpen this instrument, we apply the same mental checklists we did for ourselves, but for others too. Could they be going through the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOLmD_WVY-E">Dunning-Kruger</a> effect? Could they be using lazy mental gymnastics like <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Whataboutism">whataboutism</a>? Are they saying something like “<em>but it’s been done like this forever!</em>”?</p>
<p>As Einstein would say, &ldquo;<em>We can&rsquo;t solve problems by using the same kind of thinking we used when we created them.</em>&rdquo; We need to be aware of our fallibilities and sharpen our tools so we can dissolve bad ideas when we see them.</p>
<p><strong>3) We need to embrace the complexity of the world with humility</strong></p>
<p>With each day that passes, our world becomes even more complicated. Consider this quote from Einstein yet again, nearly one hundred years ago:</p>
<p>“<em>Specialization in every sphere of intellectual work is producing an ever-widening gulf between the intellectual worker and the non-specialist, which makes it more difficult for the life of the nation to be fertilized and enriched by the achievements of art and science.</em>”</p>
<p>It is impossible to know everything today. There is nothing wrong with voicing our opinion about climate change, wealth inequality, cryptocurrencies, vaccines, capitalism, communism, gun control, foreign policy, artificial intelligence, nuclear energy, and on and on… but we need to be cautious about one thing:</p>
<p>Each of these topics is complicated. If we try to keep presenting our positions on each of these points, and all the others we deal with today, we can spread ourselves too thin.</p>
<p>And if we spread ourselves too thin, we run a few risks. We might fall victim to bad abstractions and be the ones spreading misinformation ourselves. Or we can get into heated arguments that resolve nothing, change nobody’s ideas, and only create more friction. Or we might even run into an argument with someone who is driven by bad abstractions, but who also spent a lot of time thinking about the subject (climate change deniers, for example), and by us not knowing much about what we are saying, we can “lose” the argument and give them more strength and conviction into what they are saying.</p>
<p>So, in light of everything we have seen, let us acknowledge our ignorance. We cannot be expected to know everything about everything, and we need to be humble about that.</p>
<p>This humility is defined wonderfully by Hans Rosling, in <em>Factfulness</em>:</p>
<p>“Being humble, here, means being aware of how difficult your instincts can make it to get the facts right. It means being realistic about the extent of your knowledge. It means being happy to say “I don’t know.” It also means, when you do have an opinion, being prepared to change it when you discover new facts. It is quite relaxing being humble, because it means you can stop feeling pressured to have a view about everything, and stop feeling you must be ready to defend your views all the time.”</p>
<p>Without this pressure to defend our so many viewpoints all the time, we will gain invaluable time to investigate singular subjects a lot more deeply, so that we can be the ones at the forefront in the battles against bad ideas on a topic we are most interested in.</p>
<p>And as for the other ones, they will, hopefully, be guarded by good abstractions and this humility to say “I don’t know” before engaging in serious conversations. A large part of cleaning up our Land of Bad Abstractions are all of the small leaps of faith we will have to take. We are not able to know everything, and we will have to trust each other. So let us focus on what we can, and hope that for the other things someone else has got our back.</p>
<p><strong>4) We need to be kinder to each other</strong></p>
<p>Earlier we saw that there is a legion of psychological pitfalls we are constantly walking in. These are factors beyond our immediate control that affect the way we interact with the world.</p>
<p>Beyond logic, however, other external factors have a profound impact on how we think and who we are. And that is the experiences we have every day. How we were treated by our parents. How we experienced our friendships. The environment we grew up in. The ideas we were forced to learn or to forget. The traumas we faced. The opportunities we had.</p>
<p>What defines us today is our history, and much of that was outside of our control. And when this history is a nightmare, then we might carry scars which can later on turn into bad abstractions.</p>
<p>The relationships between broken childhoods (subject to trauma, abuse, violence, bullying, etc) and their impact on adulthood are <a href="https://bmcpublichealth.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12889-016-2906-3">well-documented</a>. We are more likely to suffer from physical and mental illnesses if we had rough years growing up.</p>
<p>Serial killers are clear illustrations of these effects. Many of them were tormented during their childhoods. Be it from sexual, physical, or substance abuse, or even outside the household through bullying, many serial killers had strong traumas in their developmental years that cascaded into broken realities later on.</p>
<p>And while not everyone will turn into a serial killer, the long-lasting effects of abuse and neglect in our early years manifests themselves through many different forms. A child who was abused by his mother might grow to become someone who cannot deal well with women, and who later during his school years might have difficulties socializing, and in a worst-case scenario, they might also be bullied by his peers at school. How does someone like that learn what empathy, kindness, and affection are? Would it be surprising if someone under those circumstances grew up to be a misogynistic troll, who ventures into dark online communities to slander women and create chaos?</p>
<p>This is not at all an excuse for that behavior. Nor is it an affirmation that every single person who acts in such a way did so because of their environment. Some people are, unfortunately, genetically wired into such tendencies. Others might have had good circumstances and still choose to act this way. In either case, we cannot tolerate this behavior as it is dangerous to others, so we must always take measures against them.</p>
<p>The more important question to me, however, is what we can do to prevent such behaviors from existing in the first place. Even the worst of ideas can still provide a sense of belonging and identity to people. Terrible abstractions which are in conflict with the well-being of society, like sexism, but which still might be the only things certain people have ever known. We must not only fight back against any manifestation of these ideas, but we also need to be equally as determined from not allowing them to arise in the first place.</p>
<p>This is obviously complicated. When I have talked to people about this, some of them seem to think that such forms of discrination are deeply embedded into human nature, and that there will never be a time where we get completely rid of racism or xenophobia, for example.</p>
<p>I disagree with that, in that I believe the human potential for reasoning transcendes beyond any notions we have about ourselves now. It is impossible to predict what will happen in the next 500 years, but I sincerely believe that there is nothing &ldquo;natural&rdquo; about bad ideas. We are simply too ignorant to know otherwise, and we can fix that ignorance. And we have been fixing it. Books like <em>Enlightnment Now</em> and <em>Factfulness</em> highlight incredibly the power that reason has at improving the human condition over time.</p>
<p>So, today, what can we do to be less reactionary and more proactive against bad ideas? What can we do to prevent people from falling into dark roads?</p>
<p>One of the answers, in my opinion, is kindness. I have <a href="https://capm96.github.io/post/parece/">written</a> about this before, but I would like to repeat it here: all we have is each other. Carl Sagan said it best when describing our <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wupToqz1e2g&amp;t=14s">Pale Blue Dot</a>.</p>
<p>This fundamental unity that we all have should serve as motivation to not put fellow human beings under the sort of stress that we mentioned above. Nobody deserves to be bullied, abused, and tormented. There is absolutely no explanation as to why we should subject a child, or an adult for that matter, to this kind of suffering.</p>
<p>As parents, if we are mature enough to bring a life into this world, we should be mature enough to care for it. And I do not mean this to oversimplify the complexity of being a parent. Circumstances change, and I do not think the majority of people willingly have children to subject them to abuse. However, literally bringing life onto this world is one of the most important acts anyone can do. It is absolutely something to not be taken lightly. And if we ought to do it, then we should also be responsible to nurture and provide to this child a life that is <em>at least</em> free from neglect, abuse, and violence.</p>
<p>As friends, we need to be more encouraging, supportive, and kind towards our peers. This is not by any means to envision a world in which we are all living happily without any sort of conflict. Human beings are inherently competitive animals, and to think we can simply prevent children from bantering is naïve even for the standards of this entire post. What I mean is that we must be better listeners. We should reach out to our friends when we think something is wrong. We need to stand up for them if someone has done them wrong. We need to bring them up, rather than pushing them down.</p>
<p>And as human beings in general… well, how would you treat someone if you knew they came from the same place as you, that they had the same thoughts as you, that they felt the same pains and joys as you, that they are just confused as lost as you, and that all their differences, regardless of how big or small, are because they were born at a different place at a different time than you? We are all blips, and we are all parts of someone else’s story too. Small and big acts of kindness go an infinitely long way.</p>
<p>And the parents, the friends, and the human beings in general who were not kind, who abused and who tormented – what drove them there? We are all inside this perpetual wheel of cause and effect, and the one who is a victim today might be the perpetrator tomorrow. So, beyond any educational system reform or any development in critical thinking skills, what we can do today is look inward and realize that we are all, ultimately, all that we have between us and this sea of infinity, and that we should be less afraid to love and embrace one another, and that everyone deserves to know what that feels like.</p>
<h2 id="summary">Summary</h2>
<p>The world is complicated. So complicated that we resort to abstractions - simpler ideas in our minds that nicely summarize something, so we do not deal with all the complexity.</p>
<p>Good abstractions hide the complexity but maintain the truth, like knowing that our ovens rely on gas, even if we do not know how. This prevents accidents from happening.</p>
<p>Bad abstractions hide the complexity but distort the truth, like believing that redheads are witches or that vaccines have microchips to track us. This incites divisiveness and suffering.</p>
<p>We live in the Matrix, and we all have access to the world’s information. This is great and terrible because it means we have a lot of misinformation to navigate through. And we suck at navigating through it because we are fallible thinkers. This generates bad abstractions.</p>
<p>Bad abstractions are permeating our lives, from dinner arguments to global policy decisions. Everywhere we can find misinformation, biases, and all sorts of nasty things that result from it.</p>
<p>To fix our Land of Bad Abstractions, we need to improve our systems and ourselves as individuals. The educational system is a massive catalyst for positive change, but we must re-evaluate what it truly stands for, and help transform it into something compatible with the modern world.</p>
<p>And as individuals, we need to be more aware of our fallibilities and sharpen our tools, we need to embrace the complexity of the world with humility, and we need to be kinder towards each other.</p>
<p>Maybe I am naïve about these changes. Maybe the world will never change. But I wear my heart on my sleeve. I believe every human being deserves a prosperous life with opportunity which free from suffering, and that reason, this innate gift that human beings possess, is the best tool we have at creating a reality that gives people these lives.</p>
<p>But we are far from such a world. As of now, we live in places where the truth is blurred, trust is broken, and cooperation is inexistent.</p>
<p>The Witch Hunts happened because we were abhorrently ignorant. They disappeared when we realized the absurdity of the idea. It is time we heal ourselves of the modern-day lapses of ignorance as well.</p>
<p>We will not suddenly fix all of the world’s problems if we all wake up tomorrow full of reason. The world is so extremely complicated. So many questions are so nuanced, and even people who are acting reasonably can still find themselves in perpetual disagreements. 
But how do we justify so many evils of the world today?</p>
<p>Reason and love should be the guiding hands of our most important decisions. And let that be the compass that puts us on a different path from where we are headed now. Because any direction from where we are going is a good start.</p>
